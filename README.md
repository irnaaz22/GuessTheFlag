Technologies :
* Swift 
* Swift UI 


In This App:

* Using stacks to arrange views
* Colors and frames
* Gradients
* Buttons and images
* Showing alert message


Using stacks to arrange views:
Each SwiftUI View returns some View for its computed body property. If we want it to contain multiple views, we can wrap it in a stack such as a VStack, HStack or ZStack. Other containers such as Group, List, Form, etc can also facilitate this need.

Colors and frames:
That SwiftUI's Color type is a View perfectly epitomizes the framework's ethos of composability. It's views all the way down -- which makes pulling off effects like full screen background colors.

Gradients:
Whether it's a LinearGradient', 'RadialGradient', or AngularGradient, the same View`-based benefits afforded to color also apply to SwiftUI gradients. Which is good... because gradients are nice.

Showing alert messages:
In UIKit, alerts would need to be constructed as part of a UIAlertController and then explicitly presented inside of another controller
In SwiftUI... alerts exist as another modifier on a view -- which binds to a certain piece of state to know whether or not it should be shown.
